<h1>Slot Getter</h1>
I made this back durring the pandemic when it was hard to find HEB curbside slots. <br>
it looked at the HEB website and if it found an open slot emailed whoever wanted to <br>
be notified then they could go sign up for it. If you want to use this code it has been<br>
a few years so if HEB has changed there website it may no longer work.<br>
